    "\n",
    "When samples are taken out of the dataset and not replaced this is known as pasting, when they are replaced bagging is being performed. Pasting means each model can learn individual patterns as there is no shared data, but a lot of data is needed for this to work well as you are affectively dividing the size of the dataset each model will learn on by the number of models in the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of bagging is that each of the classifiers may not see all of the data point in the training set even though data is being replaced. These unseen data points are known as out-of-bag samples and can be used to validate the models without the need for a seperate validation set which means more data can be used to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method of bagging involves selecting a random number of features to use for that round of training. The idea being that removing some of the features during training rounds reduces an over-reliability on a few features and makes the model learn a more generalised pattern from the data. This is very similar to how dropout can help reduce overfitting in neural networks."

Boostrapping be set to true also makes sense as the dataset isnt huge so more training data variety for each tree should improve overall performance. It seems we were also right in constraining the max depth of the tree, similar results can be seen from limiting the maximum number of features - I shall go more in depth with this later on. As for the increase in minimum samples this also makes sense as stronger decision boundaries have to be made, i.e. a boundary cannot be put between 2 samples.

    "From the above graphs we can see that adding more trees to the model only increases its performance up to a point where it begins to level of sharply. This is likely due to a limit in the amount of data or the small number of features meaning it can be represented by a reletively small number of trees and still produce a good score. From the graph on the right we can see that training time scales linearly with then number of additional trees added to the forest. From these results it seems around 15-20 decision trees in our random forest ensemble would produce optimal results with minimal complexity."

    "As we saw with our randomised search recuding tree depth gave good results for our model. Forcing each tree to be unable to learn highly complex patterns in the data means it must find stronger decision boundaries in order to perform well. These stronger decision boundaries result in a more robust model which better generalises.\n",
